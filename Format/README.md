# Format
The format's main focus is simplicity and readability.

GitBook uses a convention on top of markup files:

[README](Format/readmeFile.md): Introduction of the book.
[SUMMARY](Format/summaryFile.md): Chapters Structure.
[LANGS](Format/multiLanguages.md): Multi-Languages book.
A book needs at least a `README` and a `SUMMARY.
